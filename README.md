#Description

UCThello is a board game using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds) applied to trees (UCT in short) for the computer player AI. The board game used for demonstration purposes of the UCT algorithm is close to a game named Othello depending on selected options. In fact it can be played depending on your configuration following the official tournament rules of the WOF - World Othello Federation - if intended. Other rule settings to play variants are available, too.
