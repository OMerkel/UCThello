#Description

UCThello is a board game using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with UCB (Upper Confidence Bounds) applied to trees (UCT in short) for the computer player AI. The board game used for demonstration purposes of the UCT algorithm is close to a game named Othello depending on selected options. In fact it can be played depending on your configuration following the official tournament rules of the WOF - World Othello Federation - if intended. Other rule settings to play variants are available, too.

Othello is a derivative of the board game Reversi which can be played by UCThello as well. Reversi is claimed to be invented  by either Lewis Waterman or John W. Mollett. Predecessor of Reversi created by Mollett is The game of Annexation, also called Annex back in 19th century.
